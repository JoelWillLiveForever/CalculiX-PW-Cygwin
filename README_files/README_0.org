* CalculiX - Parallel Works 
This repository contains the open source FEM software  CalculiX with some modifications and some relevant tools. 

** current configuration
   - Based on [[http://www.calculix.de/][CalculiX]] version 2.12 (multi-threaded version, see the notes below) 
 	 
** Installing CalculiX (multi-threads):
   We followed the directions for installing CalculiX Multi-Thread on Ubuntu from
   [[http://www.libremechanics.com/?q=node/9][How To Install CalculiX 2.6 Multi-Thread On Ubuntu]]. 
   For completeness the instructions for installing (on Ubuntu 16.04) are repeated below:
   1. Install the required tools for compiling multi-threaded CalculiX: 
	  - gfortran 
	  - make 
	  - f2c	
	  - liblapack3 
	  - liblapack-dev  
	  - libexodusii-dev	
	  - libgl1-mesa-dev	 
	  - libglu1-mesa-dev 
	  - libxi-dev 
	  - libxmu-dev
	  The above packages can be installed by 
	  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  apt-get install \
      gfortran \
      make \
	  f2c	\
	  liblapack3 \
	  liblapack-dev  \
	  libexodusii-dev	\
	  libgl1-mesa-dev	 \
	  libglu1-mesa-dev \
	  libxi-dev \
	  libxmu-dev \
	  #+END_EXAMPLE
   2. If downloading the Spooles package from (http://www.netlib.org/linalg/spooles/spooles.2.2.html), 
	  make the following changes (*These changes have already been applied to the spooles files in this repository*):
	  - In =spooles.2.2/Tree/src/makeGlobalLib= change:
		=drawTree.c= to =draw.c=
	  - In =spooles.2.2/Make.inc= change:
		=CC = /usr/lang-4.0/bin/cc= to =CC = /usr/bin/cc=
   3. If downloaing the =ARPACK= (=arpack96.tar.Z=) and patch (=patch.tar.Z=) from http://www.caam.rice.edu/software/ARPACK/
	  make the following changes (*These changes have already been applied to the spooles files in this repository*):
	  - In =ARPACK/ARmake.inc= change:
		+ =home = $(HOME)/ARPACK= to =home = /usr/local/ARPACK=
		+ =PLAT = SUN4= to =PLAT = linux=
		+ =FC = f77= to =FC = gfortran=
		+ =FFLAGS = -O -cg89= to =FFLAGS = -O2=
		+ =MAKE = /bin/make= to =MAKE = /usr/bin/make=
	  - In =ARPACK/UTIL/second.f= change: 		
        =EXTERNAL ETIME= to =*EXTERNAL ETIME=
   4. Compile spooles:
	  1) Change to the spooles directory: 
		 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		 cd CalculiX-PW/spooles.2.2/    
		 #+END_EXAMPLE
	  2) Compile spooles
		 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		 make lib    && \
		 cd MT/src/   && \
		 make   
         #+END_EXAMPLE
   5. Compile ARPACK:
	  1) *Make sure you update the =home= variable in =CalculiX-PW/ARPACK/ARmake.inc=*
		 *to the root of the =ARPACK= source tree (Top level of ARPACK directory)*
	  2) Change to ARPACK directory: 
		 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		 cd CalculiX-PW/ARPACK/    
		 #+END_EXAMPLE
	  3) Compile ARPACK:
		 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		 make lib   
         #+END_EXAMPLE
	  4) To remove the object files, but keep the library you could run
		 #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
		 make clean 
		 #+END_EXAMPLE
   6. Compile CalculiX: (The CalculiX makefile in this repository =CalculiX/ccx_2.6/src/Makefile= is already updated for multi-threading)
	  #+BEGIN_EXAMPLE
	  cd CalculiX-PW/src  && \
      make  	  
	  #+END_EXAMPLE
